<h1> Visual-Crypto </h1>

Visual cryptography is a method of computer image encryption, based on human eye behaviour.
More specifically, from the image we want to encrypt ("image" can also be written on a piece of text),
we create two rectangular images, which can not be read.


In the simplest version, a two-color, black-and-white image is encrypted.
We divide it into tiny squares (pixels), each one wholly black or white.
Then, by analyzing the initial image pixel by pixel, we create two new images by computer,
let's call it a share. If the pixel is white, place the same squares in the corresponding squares (let's call it bricks)
by randomly choosing from the two shown below.
For a black pixel in the right places of shares, we put different bricks in random place.

Put two above pictures on each other and look what was encrytpted
